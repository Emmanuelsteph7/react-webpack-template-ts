Docs for this repo

steps
1, create the initial structure (src, .gitignore)
2, initialize git and package.json
3, add react and react-dom as dependencies
4, add typescript @types/react @types/react-dom as dev dependencies
5, initialize tsconfig.json using npx tsc --init
6, create the index.tsx, App.tsx and index.html files in the src folder
7, add the following as dev dependencies - @babel/core @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react @babel/preset-typescript
8, add a .babelrc config file and its configuration
9, add the following as dev dependencies - webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server html-webpack-plugin babel-loader
10, to work with css files, add css-loader and style-loader as dev dependencies
11, add the test config to webpack for css files attaching the css and style loaders
12, when importing images, typescript gives an error: "Cannot find module './image.png' or its corresponding type declarations."
to fix this, in the src folder, create a declarations.d.ts file and add "declare module "_.png""
13, in webpack 4, to handle files, we add the file-loader package, but in webpack 5, there is in-built support for files using asset resource module type
14, add the config for images in the webpack config
15, to fix importing svgs, add "declare module "_.svg"" to the declaration.d.ts
16, in webpack 4, handling svgs required url-loader, but in webpack 5, we can use the asset inline module type
